## Summary

Ollicle Reflex Byline owes a great deal (even it's name!) to the fantastic [Ollicle Reflex](http://www.ollicle.com/projects/netnewswire/reflex/), byÂ Oliver Boermans. It takes that style and calls out the author by putting their name front and center and grabbing a picture of them from Google Image Search. Clicking on the picture will show all available headshots; clicking on one will use it. Whichever headshot is chosen will be saved in a cookie and remembered for subsequent viewing.
