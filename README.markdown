## Summary

Ollicle Reflex Byline owes a great deal (even it's name!) to the fantastic [Ollicle Reflex](http://www.ollicle.com/projects/netnewswire/reflex/), byÂ Oliver Boermans. It takes that style and calls out the author by putting their name front and center and grabbing a picture of them from Google Image Search. Clicking on the picture will cycle through those available, and whichever one is chosen will be saved in a cookie and remembered for subsequent viewing.

## TODO
- Add a better selection interface, with a popup showing all available shots and letting you click on one
- More feedback after a click to show the user that something is going on
- Interface to expose the ability to use arbitrary image URLs
- Maybe a way to customize the search term, too (not all feeds expose proper author names)
